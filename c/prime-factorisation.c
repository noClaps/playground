This function takes a number to factorise, and an existing list of factors. The
list of factors is needed as this function is recursive and that is the only
way I could think of to keep track of the factors. The initial factors array
when calling this function from `main()` should be created using `malloc()` and
should not contain any values. The only reason this is necessary is because C
doesn't support default arguments.
